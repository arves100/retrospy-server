# RetroSpy Server
= ATTENTION: I will now work for this project on a different place [GameProgressive](https://github.com/gameprogressive/retrospyserver) The reason why i've created a organizzation is because, in the future, if someone will contribute there will be a better "place" than my own account. All of this will be lefted for merging with the new place. =

RetroSpy is a project that aim to create a fully working SDK and Server for GameSpy Services

This Server is completly rewritten from scratch in C/C++.
