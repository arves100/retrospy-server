# RetroSpy Server
RetroSpy is a project that aim to create a fully working SDK and Server for GameSpy Services

This Server is completly rewritten from scratch in C/C++.

Status
===

Currently the GPSP (SearchManager Server) can check for /nicks and /valid requests

Everything works only on Windows (WinSock2)

What needs to be Done
===

- Everything else

- Async Feature with WS2

- Conversion to Linux Sockets

- Testing,Testing, Testing

- Switch to CMake for Cross-Compiling

- Database Support (WIP)

Contribution
===

Feel free to contribute (maybe with that platform that i could not test)

I'd like to have full Platforms and Compilers supported for this project.

Notes
===

- Currently the Server dosen't have any license (see [here](https://choosealicense.com/no-license/) for details), unless i decide.

Special Thanks
